# Compliance API

This is an experiment in exposing compliance data via an API.
The core ideas are:

* No gap between reporting and reality
* Realtime reporting.
* API to enable automation
* API flips responsibility: Ask don't tell.

This project assumes the existence of Kubernetes, an assumption that means that
a large part of the world is introspectable, observable and therefore verifiable in
ways that have not previously been possible.
